This map shows the real time air quality index from the nearest measurement station. Initially the application will start with a city selected, other locations can be accessed through the location selector, incl. the location of the server running the shiny app based on the approximate IP location.

The data is pulled as json object from the World Air Quality Index homepage. First the current location data is extracted and then a second API request is made to get the nearby measurement stations.
